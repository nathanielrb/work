*** TODO Parent/child queries ??
** Access Rights
   In a next step, we assume access rights may spoil the initial
   party.  We need to cope with access rights in order to figure out
   what belongs together.  The most realistic path forward is to
   consume the `mu-auth-used-groups` and compare them with the
   `mu-auth-allowed-groups` for a specific query.

   - Read and parse `MU-AUTH-USED-GROUPS` and `MU-AUTH-ALLOWED-GROUPS`
     when building index.
   - Store `MU-AUTH-USED-GROUPS` and `MU-AUTH-ALLOWED-GROUPS` so you
     can match on it later.
   - Compare MU-AUTH-ALLOWED-GROUPS to select the index to query on
     when the user poses a question.

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   NOTE MU-AUTH-ALLOWED-GROUPS always contains the groups from which
   the current user may select.  These are included with the request
   that’s received from the user.  (If no MU-AUTH-ALLOWED-GROUPS is
   received, it will be calculated on the first request to the
   database.) MU-AUTH-USED-GROUPS is received when a user poses a
   question to the database.  This array follows the same form as
   MU-AUTH-ALLOWED-GROUPS.  It is an array of objects.  If the value
   for the name property of one of these objects appears in
   MU-AUTH-ALLOWED-GROUPS, but not in MU-AUTH-USED-GROUPS, then it
   will never appear there.  This means that if a user pops along, and
   they have the same access rights as a MU-AUTH-ALLOWED-GROUPS of a
   previous query, you will receive the same values again.  If the
   user has less MU-AUTH-ALLOWED-GROUPS, but none which appear in
   MU-AUTH-USED-GROUPs, the same index can be used once again.

** Stored indexes
   When the application is stopped, and booted up again, the indexes
   don’t need to rebuilt, they can be stored.  As long as the contents
   of the triplestore haven’t changed when the system was offline,
   it’s safe to assume the index is still in tact.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
   NOTE The Delta service is currently rather naïve in that it assumes
   everybody is listening by the time it detects changes. There’s a fair
   chance your service boots up too late, and therefore misses some of
   these Deltas.  It is an ongoing story to upgrade the Delta service so
   you can receive recent changes when booting up.

   Indexing on first request has its downsides.  We should be able to
   answer to initial requests quickly, given a set of expected access
   patterns.  When the stack boots up, we will build the indexes for a
   predefined set of MU_AUTH_ALLOWED_GROUPS so users will receive answers
   quickly.

*** DONE Build a fresh index once everything has been booted up correctly :v1:
    Note that you may start receiving Deltas at the same time, so you
    may want to hold off for a moment when starting to build the first
    indexes.

** Automatic index invalidation
   When users pose a question, we can verify the index, and update it
   automatically.  We will consume the Delta supplied by
   mu-authorization to detect possibly destructive changes. Because of
   this, we need to have a thorough understanding of the contents
   which need to be indexed.  As such, we need to define a new
   specification language to easily reason on.  The specifics of this
   approach need some further detailing.

   Instead of invalidating the index, let’s update it dynamically.

   Many events from the delta service could be translated directly to
   index updates, rather than index invalidations.  We will detect the
   changes to be made, and apply them directly.  It is ok to pose further
   queries to the SPARQL endpoint in order to figure out the impact of
   the change.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE 
   NOTE This section currently ignores the access rights
   with respect to the Delta Service.  Description of the access
   rights should be considered in another tasks which runs parallel to
   this one.  The inclusion of access rights with the delta service
   will have an impact on how this story unfolds.  It is safe to
   assume that the MU_AUTH_USED_GROUPS for a given
   MU_AUTH_ALLOWED_GROUPS will never change.

   When configuring the search service during development, it is to be
   expected that the configuration will change often.  Many microservices
   monitor their configuration/code in development mode, and refresh
   their state when changes occur.

    so getting lodged in somewhere

    one solution: don't use 'set :x' for reloading, but that makes it
    unintuitive sinatra
** Eager indexing from the semantic model

   Some configuration regarding the MU_AUTH_ALLOWED_GROUPS may be
   dependent on data in the system.  The search should update this
   part of its configuration based on SPARQL queries, rather than
   based on configuration files.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
NOTE It is clear that, at some point, the Delta service
should be able to inform your service about potential changes to the
result of particular SPARQL queries.  This is an ongoing effort, but
is not expected to mature by the time the search is complete.  We will
therefore let the user manage this in configuration.
